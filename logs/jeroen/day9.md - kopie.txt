Log day 9:
Today we basically finished the project. 
First we tried many different combinations of values for our Deep Neural network.
Then we decided which was the best architecture to use and further tweaked the optimization parameters.
Much time went in writing the report and creating informative visualizations of the data.
Finally, we also stacked all the three models we built and got the best accuracy so far using that :).
