Log day 2.
Morning:
After a short meeting I continued working on the decision tree and deep neural network basics.

Afternoon:
After we discovered that the data is very unbalanced, 
I looked up some better metrics to evaluate our model and how to handle unbalanced data in general.
We implemented the confusion matrix and balanced accuracy score to get better insight in model performance.
Finished the day by writing the report for the basic model.
