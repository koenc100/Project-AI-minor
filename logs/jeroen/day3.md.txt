Log day 3.
Morning:
We decided to check each others code and try to understand it and possibly make it better.
Optimized both the preprocessing and created a get_metrics function that returns the evaluation metrics in a nice format.

Afternoon:
I worked mainly again on the k-Nearest Neighbors. I found out that there are ways to deal with categorical data in kNN too,
so I implemented that in the model.
We further had some discussion about ways to further optimize the Deep Neural Network in the future.
