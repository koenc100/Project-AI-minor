Log day 5.

During a morning meeting we discussed how to further work on the different models. 

I have been only working on the deep neural network, besides having some discussion on the other models.
Today I have been mainly working on the implementation of cross-validation on the Deep neural network model.
This was a complex piece of code, especially finding good ways to store all the different metrics we use for our validation.

I used the cross-validation to further search for optimal parameters for our model, such as the class weight.
Some extra changes I made on the DNN pipeline were: 
replacing all binary 0 values in categorical data to -1,
adding a fixed pseudo-random state of the model weights, in order to better evaluate parameter changes.
I helped writing the code for some data augmentations.
