Log day 7.
Morning: We had a morning discussion on how to proceed on optimizing or models.
I started on working on different model architectures to find some optimal values for this too. This still is a work in progress, that needs finetuning.
After that, I worked on the code design for the neural network model after which we had a round of checking each others code for design and readability.


Afternoon. We had a feedback moment with Tim, who gave a lot of small details and some large points in the report.
The rest of the afternoon we worked on implementing those points.
