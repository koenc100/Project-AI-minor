Log day 8:
Morning:
Today I started by rerunning some of the base models since there seemed to be still some mistakes in the report for the baseline model data.
I worked on some more text of both the report and the DNN that had to be added.

Afternoon:
I worked on optimizing settings for many of the different parameters and stored the results in an excel file, in search of a better balanced accuracy of the model.
I also implemented a random-forest like way to stack different deep neural networks,
each one trained on a different set of the training data (where each time all stroke data were used).
In some way this can be seen as an undersampling method for the non-stroke data.
Since we have many hyperparameters to tweak now, all that is left to do for the neural network is to optimize the parameters.
