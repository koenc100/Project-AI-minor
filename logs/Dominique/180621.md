## Log Friday week 1
This morning I worked on plotting the k-NN accuracies and balanced accuracies per value for k, and I added this to report. In the afternoon I made a random forest in our decision tree notebook, which didn’t really help for accuracies. I’m still working using multiple decision trees trained on a subset of the dataset of people without strokes and always trained on people with strokes as a classification model, but I’m struggling with getting it to work. 
On Monday I’ll have to add to the report.
