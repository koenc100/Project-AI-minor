## Log thursday week 2
This morning I worked on finishing up oversampling for the decision trees by using Koen's 3D plot to find optimal splits in combination with the optimal ratio for oversampling. Then I worked on the report, just like everyone else, mainly for decision trees but I also ended up changing the last few parts for k-NN to make sure the model  was being trained on validation data and only then evaluated on tested data.
Tomorrow I'll be writing documentation for the decision tree and cleaning it up as the first thing.
