## Log tuesday week 1
Today I continued working on the k-NN algorithm; I looked up the user guide for the sci-kit kNN, and found a figure here that I recreated, which was nice because I really struggled with plotting the figure yesterday. Afterwards, I actually created the k-NN model, and tried this on the stroke dataset. I also wrote a function to measure accuracy for this model, before finding out that this is a method in sci-kit. I also read more in the user guide about what the model actually does, to write some documentation and start writing the part of the chapter of the report on the k-NN. We also constructed confusion matrixes to check if our suspicions that it’s just classifying all data as stroke-less was correct.
I also updated some documentation for our data_extraction script and I’ve been writing the to-do list per part of the day for the group.
