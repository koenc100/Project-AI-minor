Today I worked on applying oversampling on the decision tree, which took more time than expected; I had some errors I really struggled with while editing the oversampling file, as the code was not very clear or multi-applicable yet. I also reworked the data extraction function to transform all categorical data into one-hot encoded data, and made this function more general as the previous way of one-hot encoding data was very specific to certain variables, instead of it being able to extract categorical features out of a dataset itself.
Tomorrow I will try to better the balanced decision tree further by looking for ways to find two of the best hyperparameters, and I will work on the report.
