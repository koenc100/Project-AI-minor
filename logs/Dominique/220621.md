## Tuesday week 2
This morning Jana and I improved the decision tree model with pair programming, like class weights and plotting the effect of this, applying the min sample size to our final decision tree model. We also looked up different ways to improve the model, but we didn’t really find anything, so in the afternoon we decided to exchange code with Jeroen to check each other’s implementation and documentation, together with Jana again. This was quite complicated, so it took us some time. We also received  feedback from Tim. 
Tomorrow I’ll be working on applying oversampling to our decision tree and discussing the code feedback with Jeroen/Koen.
