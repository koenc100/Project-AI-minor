## Log monday week 2
On Friday, I finished our ‘ensembled forest’, which Jana and I worked on today to convert to a function and to also add some plots with our converted functions. After this, I added documentation while she worked on adding our findings to the report. After this, I also worked on the report and handed it in; I mostly worked on part 2 and 3 of chapter 2.
