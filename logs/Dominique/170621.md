## Log wednesday week 1
Today we mainly worked on processing feedback, so I helped with the interpretation of past notebooks, and I spent some time updating our data_processing function with a normalization function in pair programming with Jana, as well as looking for a way to always include data for people with strokes in testing data and dealing with NA-values in a different way. I also added quite some comments and documentation to this script. I, as well as everyone else, also added to the report to process feedback and start chapter 2.
Tomorrow weâ€™ll be looking at ways to improve our model accuracy.
