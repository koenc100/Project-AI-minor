## Log monday week 1
Today we figured out which project we wanted to do and I made a Google Docs and copied all the information regarding the report and the things we will be judged on coding-wise. 
After we divided what everyone was working on, Jeroen and I worked on the algorithms we will try, one of them being k-Nearest Neighbours. I looked at implementations of this using ski-kit that we didn't use way back in Machine Learning 1. This implementation was not too difficult, however I really struggled with making a plot out of it as we did way back in module 2 there, as ski-kit requires a matrix to predict class, which is different from what we used there, so I spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to fix this or looking up a way to make a Voronoi diagram. This didn’t really work, so I should probably either ask someone else to look at it or try with the proper dataset and do something myself instead of using the old code that doesn’t work for this case anymore.
